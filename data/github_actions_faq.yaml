  - question: How do I pass data between jobs?
    answer: "Use outputs and the needs keyword to pass data between jobs in a workflow."
  - question: How do I use artifacts?
    answer: "Use the actions/upload-artifact and actions/download-artifact actions to share files between jobs or store build outputs."
  - question: How do I limit workflow concurrency?
    answer: "Use the concurrency key in your workflow to limit the number of concurrent runs and cancel in-progress runs if needed."
  - question: How do I use conditional steps?
    answer: "Use the if key in steps to run them only when certain conditions are met, e.g., if: github.event_name == 'push'."
  - question: How do I access context variables?
    answer: "GitHub provides context objects like github, env, and job that you can use to access event data, environment variables, and job information."
